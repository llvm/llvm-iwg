# Decision 1: Working on a Mailman to Discourse migration

## Background

The LLVM foundation requested the Infrastructure working group (IWG) to work on
a mailman to discourse migration [#6](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-iwg/issues/6).

## Decision

1. The IWG accepts the request from the LLVM foundation.
2. The IWG sets up a sub-group who will work in this topic. The sub-group will
   initially consist of:
   * Kit Barton
   * Mike Edwards
   * Christian KÃ¼hnel
   * Chris Lattner

   More people are welcome to join.
3. The sub-group will keep the rest of the IWG updated on the progress.
4. The sub-group will be dissolved once the migration is completed or was
   cancelled.
