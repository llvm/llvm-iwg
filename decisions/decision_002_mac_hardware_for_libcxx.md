# Decision 2: MacOS hardware for libc++ pre-merge testing

## Background

Louis Dionne requested MacOS machines for the libc++ pre-merge testing
[#32](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-iwg/issues/32).

The details for the board are in a [proposal for the
board](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gGPIvsUd7hLIRK8Kq3h_otlnpImBgBZlHSONvLWMe1E/).
That document has limited visibility as it contains pricing information.
Please request access in case you want to see the details.

*Comment: We need to agree on a way to handle non-public information in the
working group [#33](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-iwg/issues/33).*

## Decision

1. The infrastructure working group (IWG) supports this request.
2. The Infrastructure Working Group(IWG) would like to recommend
   purchasing a twelve (12) month contract MacMiniVault to the board. IWG will
   work  with the vendor to provide the Foundation Board with all necessary
   paperwork for fiscal and legal review.  Once the contract is approved and
   the account is established, IWG will work with the vendor and the libc++ Team
   to coordinate access to the hardware.  At least one IWG member and one Board
   member will retain root level access to the leased hardware at all times.
