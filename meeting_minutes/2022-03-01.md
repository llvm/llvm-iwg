# working group meeting on 2022-03-01

The agenda is in the [Kanban board](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-iwg/projects/1)

## Participants

* Christian KÃ¼hnel
* Anja Gerbes
* Mikhail Goncharov
* Reid Kleckner
* Kamau Bridgeman
* Anton Korobeynikov

## moving pre-merge to an LLVM repo
 
* Galina: OK to move pre-merge scripting to zorg, write RFC first
* message on Discourse should be enough (e.g. on https://discourse.llvm.org/c/llvm/5)

## We have spam comments on Phabricator

created new issue [#99&(https://github.com/llvm/llvm-iwg/issues/99)

## Github rolling out notifications

* see https://discourse.llvm.org/t/label-based-notification/60517
  * No replies on the thread so far --> do we want to advertise for this more?
    Advertise on "announcements" category
  * Are enough people watching this category on Discourse?
  * It would be good to have a "transitive category watch" feature: If you
    watch the top level category, you're also watching all sub-categories
    below that.
  * Pending
    [feature request for discourse](https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-does-one-subscribe-to-all-posts-categories/64423)
  * Created [#101](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-iwg/issues/101) for tracking.
* current solution still offers more features (e.g. missing notifications
  on changing labels to exsisting issue) so we will keep that

## Address additional feedback on Discourse migration #98
