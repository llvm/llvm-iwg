# working group meeting on 2022-03-29

The agenda is in the [Kanban board](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-iwg/projects/1)

## Participants

* Christian KÃ¼hnel
* Kamau Bridgeman
* Reid Kleckner

## General discussion on IWG setup  

* So far the working group wasn't very successful as we lack enough people and time to get work done.
  * So it does not make sense to have more people discuss things unless we have more headcount for infrastructure work.
  * Outsourcing pending on foundation.
