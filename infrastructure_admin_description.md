# Infrastructure Admin Consultant

## Problem Statement

The LLVM Foundation is responsible for overseeing the infrastructure for the
LLVM project.  In the past, the infrastructure has been maintained by a
small number of board members and volunteers.  However, as the project
has grown it's becoming more difficult for this group to respond promptly
to issues as they arise.  In order to ensure a good experience for the
LLVM developers and users, the LLVM Foundation would like to hire
a contractor to act as an Infrastructure Admin to manage the infrastructure and
provide a guarantee of a reasonable response times for any problems that might
occur.

## Scope of Work

### Main Responsibility

The main responsibility of the Infrastructure Admin would be to respond to
and help resolve infrastructure issues reported by community members.  Issues
will be reported to the Infrastructure Admin by email or in an issue tracker
(e.g. bugzilla or GitHub Issues).  Some examples of issues that the
Infrastructure Admin would be responsible for resolving are:

- Automatic update process for the website fails.
- Infrastructure server runs out of disk space.
- Infrastructure server needs upgrade.
- Issues with Mailman list server.
- Problems with the LLVM Organization configuration on GitHub.
- Phabricator instance becoming unreachable.
- Establish monitoring and alerting for our services, check against SLOs
- In critical cases: work with community members to increase stability of their services.

### Secondary Responsibilities

In addition to resolving issues with the project's infrastructure, the
Infrastructure Admin may be asked to help with special projects for the
LLVM Foundation.  Some examples of this include:

- Migrating data from bugzilla to GitHub issues.
- Migrating mailing lists from mailman to Discourse.
- LLVM website redesgin.
- Configuring continuous integration systems.
- Regularly running surveys to understand the community's needs better.
- Improve notifications on GitHub issues, so that users can better filter on what notification they want to receive.
- Establish Terms of Service and Privacy Agreements for all of our services.
- Handle (or help the community handle) GDPR deletion requests.
