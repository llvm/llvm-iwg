# Priorities of the infrastructure working group

This document describes the priorities of the LLVM infrastructure working group
(IWG). The intention of the document is to help the IWG prioritize their
work and help working group members align on goals.

Priorities of the working group, sorted from high to low:

1. Ensure stable operations of existing LLVM development infrastructure and
   developer workflows ("keeping the lights on"). That includes
   - understanding urgent operations issues, tracking them and ensuring they
     get fixed,
   - agreeing and monitoring service level objectives (SLO) of our
     development infrastructure to be able to identify issues, and
   - updating the documentation on workflows and infrastructure to reflect
     the status quo and the latest decisions.

2. Driving improvements of services and workflows that keep causing issues
   (crashes, bad performance, security, high maintenance effort, high cost, ...)
   based on community feedback and service monitoring. This includes finding
   community members or hiring contractors to implement these improvements.

3. Help the community come to decisions around mid and long-term improvements of
   development workflows and infrastructure, and help getting these decisions
   implemented. This includes
   - understanding community pain points,
   - identifying and proposing areas for improvements,
   - active involvement in the discussion and decision processes, and
   - ensuring these decisions get implemented at a reasonable velocity.
